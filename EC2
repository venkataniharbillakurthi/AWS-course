# EC2 
    EC2 means Elastic cloud compute. The EC2 is one of the most widely used and one of the most popular services that AWS provide. And AWS is follows the PAY-AS-YOU-GO.
    The compute means that you are requesting AWS to provide you a compute instance which is a combination of cpu ram and disk like a virtual server. And the cloud means provide virtual machine instance. 

# why is it important?
  - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
  - Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability.
  - Provide secure compute for your applications. Security is built into the foundation of Amazon EC2 with the AWS Nitro System.
  - Optimize performance and cost with flexible options like AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.

# Types of EC2?
   1.General 
        General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of applications, including web servers,small databases, development and test environments, and more.

   2.Compute optimized
        Compute Optimized instances provide a higher ratio of compute power to memory. They excel in workloads that require high-performance processing such as batch processing, scientific modeling, gaming servers, and high-performance web servers.

   3.Memory optimized
        Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads. They are suitable for applications that require large amounts of memory, such as in-memory databases,real-time big data analytics, and high-performance computing.

   4.Storage optimized
        Storage Optimized instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets. They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems.

   5.Accelerated computing
       Accelerated Computing Instances typically come with one or more types of accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These accelerators offload computationally intensive tasks from the main CPU, enabling faster and more efficient processing for specific workloads.
